  <p>The DHL Materials Collector is one of the key tools to enable the Dag Hammarskj&ouml;ld Library to collect UN-produced digital materials such as publications, reports, documents, and databases. It allows author departments and materials owners the ability to describe and quickly submit for inclusion into the Digital Repository the large numbers of materials that are useful to the Organization but so far uncollected and unavailable for wider dissemination.  </p>
  <p>The Library is working with author departments to collect these materials so that they can be further described by our information professionals and made available for the benefit of the Member States, the Organization, and, where possible, the general public.  To that end, we are in the process of collaboratively identifying items to be included and developing practices and policies around the description and collection of those materials.</p>
